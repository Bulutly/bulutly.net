                The site seal offers visual proof of the security provided by
                your website’s SSL certificate. It’s so important, in fact, that
                it’s become the main reason many website owners and managers buy
                an SSL certificate as most web users know to look for it. Seals
                vary in appearance depending on the type of SSL certificate
                issued, but they all mean the same thing: your user’s data is
                protected.

              <p class="coodiv-text-11 font-weight-light">
                The level of security provided by an SSL certificate is
                determined by the number of bits used to generate the encryption
                key. That key is then used to encrypt the data. Most of our SSL
                certificates use either 256-bit or 128-bit encryption, depending
                on the capabilities of web browser and server. Both 256- and
                128-bit are industry standard for data protection.
